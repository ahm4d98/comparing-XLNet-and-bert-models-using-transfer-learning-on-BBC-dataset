# pre-training-XLnet-and-Bert-model-using-emotions-dataset-and-fine-tuning-using-BBC-dataset
transfer learning is transfering knowledge of an already trained machine learning model is applied to a different but related problem
applying various text preprocessing techniques such as removing unnecessary URLS and Emails, undersampling the emotions dataset by a custom undersampler function on raw text
chossing suitable hyperparameter for each model where XLnet needed a smaller learning rate than bert
